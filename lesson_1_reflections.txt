How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Viewing diff between two files help me to find bugs because I can quickly check wich line(s) of code have changed.
So this is better than checking manualy complete files.

---------------------------------------

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It make me a better programmer in the long terme because I can know what have been done on every files I want.
I can have a better control on my work.

---------------------------------------

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

With automatic saving you don't have to worry about when saving but there's no logical meaning.
With manual saving you got to take care about when you should save.
But if you do it correclty it will improve you control on your code history.

---------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Most of users of Google Docs don't need such fonctionality because they don't need to track change between files.

---------------------------------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log I can see all commits that have been done on a file.
With git diff I can see the difference between two commits on that file.

---------------------------------------

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I more confident because I know that it possible for me to revert anything I need to.

---------------------------------------

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Now I would like to create my own repository.

---------------------------------------

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I will put in the staging area only the files that are related to that logical change.

---------------------------------------

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches can be helpful when I need to test an experimental version or create a specific version.
It help because I can work on wich branch I want to and commit changes only on this branch.

---------------------------------------

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

This help me to visualize branch structure by helping me to know which commit belong to wich branch, 
wich commit is parent of the other and to visualize easly unreachable commit.
It's a kind of map that help me to navigate.
 
---------------------------------------

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The result is that we obtain a commit that contain modifications of the two branch.
Because we need to keep the parents relations of the commits.
