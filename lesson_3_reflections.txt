---------------------------------------

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I use a remote repo when I need to colaborate with over dev or if I want to work on a another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It may be better to pull changes manually because I need to control exactly what version is on my computer 
and maybe is not the same as the remote.
