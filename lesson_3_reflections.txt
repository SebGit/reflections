---------------------------------------

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I use a remote repo when I need to colaborate with over dev or if I want to work on a another computer.

---------------------------------------

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It may be better to pull changes manually because I need to control exactly what version is on my computer 
and maybe is not the same as the remote.

---------------------------------------

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is copy of a remote repository onto GitHub.
Clones is copy of remote or a local repository on local computer.
Branches is not a copy as forks or clones, it creates a new version of a repository.

---------------------------------------

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It's good because we can work with that copy offline and compare it with your branches.

---------------------------------------

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate by email, sending my code with comments to all the other developers.
It would be easier and faster for a very small dev with one or two developers.
But it will be nearly impossible for middle or big dev.

---------------------------------------

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would do that when I need to try something or to be sure of my code before merging to master branch.
That workflow is harder but safer.
