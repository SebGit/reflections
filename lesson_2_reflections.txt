What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a new reposotory it will create a Git hidden directory .git
This one will contain metadata that git use.
We need it because git need it to run.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It differs from them because you don't really store data in it. It's just a place where to put file(s) that wait to be commited.
So you can choose wich files to be commited and make your versioning more logical.
